I noticed that on my laptop it runs at a normal speed, but on my pc it runs slow. I dont know why.

things I didnt do:
- speed toggle
- random spin
- rotate scene on x, y, z, mouse


Options I did:
- spray toggle mode
- particles have different colors toggle
- particles have different size toggle
- square hole in ground which particles fall through (toggle it, defult not there)
- new effect - slow motion
- new effect - toggle number of particles (lots, meduim, a little)
